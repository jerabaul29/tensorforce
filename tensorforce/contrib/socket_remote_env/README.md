This code allows to wrap the environment through a socket for training through the network. For example, this allows
to run environments on a set of machine, and the Agent on a separate machine.

This code was developped originally in:

```
Rabault, J., Kuhnle, A (2019).
Accelerating Deep Reinforcement Leaning strategies of Flow Control through a
multi-environment approach.
Physics of Fluids.
```
